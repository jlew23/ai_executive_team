# AI Executive Team - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to fix two critical issues with the AI Executive Team system:
1. Knowledge Base Integration - The system is not properly using the knowledge base when generating responses
2. Delegation System - The CEO agent is answering everything instead of delegating to specialized agents

## Issue 1: Knowledge Base Integration

### Current State
- The frontend sends the `use_kb` parameter to the backend via the `/chat/api/send` endpoint
- The knowledge base contains information about MyTGuy (an IT company)
- Agents are generating fictional information instead of using the knowledge base

### Root Causes
1. The `use_kb` parameter might not be properly passed to the agent's response generation method
2. The knowledge base search functionality might not be working correctly
3. The agent's response generation might be ignoring the knowledge base context

### Implementation Plan
1. Locate the implementation of the `/chat/api/send` endpoint in `run_dashboard.py`
2. Verify that the `use_kb` parameter is being passed to the agent's response generation
3. Modify the agent's response generation to prioritize knowledge base context when `use_kb` is true
4. Add logging to track knowledge base usage and search results
5. Test with queries about MyTGuy to ensure the system uses the knowledge base

## Issue 2: Delegation System

### Current State
- The CEO agent (DirectorAgent) is trying to answer all questions instead of delegating
- The delegation logic exists but is not working effectively
- The confidence threshold for delegation is too high (0.7)

### Root Causes
1. High confidence threshold prevents delegation
2. Keyword matching for determining the best agent is not effective
3. The agent dictionary might not be properly populated

### Implementation Plan
1. Lower the confidence threshold for delegation (from 0.7 to 0.4)
2. Improve the keyword matching algorithm to:
   - Give higher weights to keyword matches
   - Award bonus points for keywords at the beginning of messages
   - Award bonus points for multiple occurrences of the same keyword
3. Expand domain-specific keywords for each department
4. Boost confidence scores with a baseline to make delegation more likely
5. Reduce the default confidence for the CEO handling messages
6. Test with various domain-specific queries to ensure proper delegation

## Testing Plan
1. Test knowledge base integration with queries about MyTGuy
2. Test delegation with queries related to different departments
3. Verify that the CEO delegates technical questions to the CTO
4. Verify that the knowledge base information is used correctly

## Success Criteria
1. Knowledge Base Integration:
   - System correctly uses information from the knowledge base about MyTGuy
   - No fictional information is generated when knowledge base contains relevant data

2. Delegation System:
   - CEO agent delegates technical questions to the CTO
   - CEO agent delegates financial questions to the CFO
   - CEO agent delegates marketing questions to the CMO
   - CEO agent delegates operational questions to the COO
   - CEO agent only answers questions about company strategy and leadership
