# AI Executive Team - Implementation Tasks

## Issue 1: Knowledge Base Integration

### Investigation Tasks
- [x] Locate the implementation of the `/chat/api/send` endpoint in `run_dashboard.py`
- [x] Examine how the `use_kb` parameter is handled in the backend
- [x] Check how the knowledge base search is implemented
- [ ] Verify that the knowledge base contains correct information about MyTGuy
- [ ] Check Supabase configuration and connection
- [ ] Verify that environment variables for Supabase are properly set

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Modify the chat endpoint to properly handle the `use_kb` parameter
- [x] Enhance the agent's response generation to prioritize knowledge base context
- [x] Add logging for knowledge base searches and usage
- [x] Implement fallback to generic responses only when knowledge base has no relevant information
- [ ] Ensure Supabase connection is properly initialized
- [ ] Fix any issues with Supabase vector storage and retrieval

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Test queries about MyTGuy with knowledge base enabled
- [ ] Verify that responses contain accurate information from the knowledge base
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty knowledge base, irrelevant queries)

## Issue 2: Delegation System

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Lower the confidence threshold for delegation from 0.7 to 0.4
- [x] Improve the keyword matching algorithm for better agent selection
- [x] Expand domain-specific keywords for each department
- [x] Add confidence boosting to make delegation more likely
- [x] Reduce the default confidence for CEO handling messages

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Test technical queries to verify delegation to CTO
- [ ] Test financial queries to verify delegation to CFO
- [ ] Test marketing queries to verify delegation to CMO
- [ ] Test operational queries to verify delegation to COO
- [ ] Test general company queries to verify CEO handling

## Final Integration and Testing
- [ ] Ensure both fixes work together correctly
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing with various query types
- [ ] Document the changes and improvements
- [ ] Create a demo script to showcase the fixed functionality
